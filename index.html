  <h2>Hi!</h2>

  <p>I'm Zach Kirsch, a rising senior at Tufts University pursuing degrees in
  Computer Science and Math. I just got back from <a href="abroad/">studying
  abroad</a> in Milan and traveling around Europe.</p>

  <h2>At Tufts...</h2>

  <p>I've done a lot of programming, but recently, I've become more
  interested in the theoretical side of computer science. There's a few courses
  I've especially enjoyed: <i>Computation Theory</i> with Ben Hescott,
  <i>Algorithms</i> with Greg Aloupis, and <i>Computer Systems Security</i>
  with Ming Chow, in which I
  <a href="/assets/quantum_risk.pdf" target="_blank">
    wrote
  </a>
  about encryption methods that are vulnerable to quantum computing. I'm
  planning on doing a senior thesis next year, but am still deciding on a
  topic.

  <p>Last semester, I TA'ed <i>Introduction to Computer Science</i> and
  <i>Computation Theory</i> and had a great time with both. I like the
  challenge of explaining new and difficult concepts to students in a way that
  gets them excited about computer science.

  <h2>Outside of school...</h2>

  <p>I've worked on a few projects to practice what I've learned. I used to
  participate in competitive debate, so a lot of what I've done on my own is
  related to that. Here are some highlights:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I created DebateRanker, a system for ranking debaters with the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system"
      target="_blank">Elo</a> and <a href="http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html"
      target="_blank">Glicko</a> ratings systems. It pulls competition results
      from online sources, normalizes the data, and integrates it into the
      existing rankings. At last count, there were over 70,000 recorded pairings.
      DebateRanker was acquired by Victory Briefs to power their <a
      href="http://vbriefly.com/rankings/" target="_blank">national debate
      rankings</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
      The first program I ever wrote was <a href="http://www.debatehelper.com/"
      target="_blank">DebateHelper</a>.  It's a Microsoft Word template
      decked out with VBA 7 that helps collaboratively organize and consolidate
      research. Since I released it in 2014, it's been downloaded over 2,000
      times.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Over the summer...</h2>

  <p>I like to get a feel for what the working world is like for programmers.
  Last summer, I worked at Microsoft's Azure Customer Insights. As part of a
  team, I created a tool to mirror SQL stores in a graph model format to allow
  for relationship-based querying. This summer I'll be at Palantir Technologies
  in Washington, D.C.</p>
